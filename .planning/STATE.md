# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-01)

**Core value:** Two (or more) people with different tastes can independently pick movies they'd watch and get a fast, confident answer to "what do we actually both want to watch tonight" — without the back-and-forth debate.
**Current focus:** Phase 1 - Persistence Foundation

## Current Position

Phase: 1 of 6 (Persistence Foundation)
Plan: Not yet planned
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-01 — Roadmap created from requirements and research; 22/22 v1 requirements mapped across 6 phases

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: Horizontal-layer build order chosen (Persistence -> Session/Lobby -> TMDB Catalog -> Vote/Match -> Real-Time -> Frontend SPA) specifically to prove backend correctness before UI, since that's where the prior prototype failed.
- Roadmap: Real-time layer deliberately sequenced last so REST/DB correctness can be verified without WebSocket "magic" masking bugs.
- Roadmap: Phase 2 (Session/Lobby) and Phase 3 (TMDB Catalog) have no dependency on each other and may be built in either order.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 4 planning needs a concrete concurrency mechanism decision (optimistic locking vs. transactional SQL count) for the "everyone finished" race — flagged by research as the highest-risk logic in the app.
- Phase 5 planning should review current `@stomp/stompjs` v7 reconnect/resubscribe semantics before implementation (avoid duplicate-message-on-reconnect).
- Phase 3 planning should re-verify current TMDB rate-limit and image-CDN connection-limit numbers against official docs (research flagged these as low-confidence, forum-sourced).
- Late-joiner / abandoned-participant handling needs an explicit product decision during Phase 2/4 planning (research flags this as silently breaking results if left undefined).
